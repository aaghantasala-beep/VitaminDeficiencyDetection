## Vitamin Deficiency Detection Using Image Processing
Overview:
Vitamin deficiency is a common health issue that can lead to various physical and medical complications if not identified early. This project focuses on detecting possible vitamin deficiencies by analyzing images of visible physical features such as the skin, eyes, nails, or tongue using image processing techniques. The system is designed to assist in early screening and healthcare awareness, especially in areas with limited access to medical facilities.

Objectives:
To study visible physical indicators related to vitamin deficiencies
To apply image processing techniques for analyzing health-related images
To extract meaningful features from images and identify deficiency patterns
To provide an indicative result that supports early awareness and prevention

Tools & Technologies :
Python
OpenCV
Image Processing Techniques
Machine Learning algorithms

Methodology / Working:
The user uploads an image of a relevant body part
The image is preprocessed (resizing, noise removal, normalization)
Important features are extracted from the image
The system analyzes the features and predicts possible vitamin deficiency
The result is displayed to the user

Intended Users:
Students and researchers working on healthcare-related projects
Educational institutions and academic demonstrations
Health awareness and screening initiatives
